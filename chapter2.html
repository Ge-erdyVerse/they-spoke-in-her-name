  <p>The boat moves without sound, or perhaps sound has learned to follow it quietly.</p>

  <p>Water parts beneath the hull in slow, deliberate folds. It is thick and dark, heavy with the smell of salt, decaying leaves, and something older that does not belong fully to either. The river feels alive beneath you, not flowing so much as breathing, rising and falling in long, patient cycles. You sit low in the boat, close enough to the surface to feel that breath brush against your skin, cool and damp, carrying with it the weight of places untouched by sunlight.</p>

  <p>On both banks, the forest leans inward.</p>

  <p>Mangroves crowd the water’s edge, their roots breaking through mud like knuckles frozen mid-clench. They do not grow upward so much as outward, sideways, into everything available. Trunks twist around one another in slow, determined spirals, as if competing for space or holding each other upright. Moonlight struggles to pass through the canopy. What little reaches the water arrives fractured, scattered into thin, uncertain streaks that vanish as soon as they appear.</p>

  <p>Leaves whisper though there is no wind.</p>

  <p>The air feels dense, almost physical, pressing against your chest and face. It is heavy with watching. You do not see eyes, but you feel them. From the branches overhead. From the water slipping past the hull. From places that do not require bodies to look. The awareness settles into you gradually, the way humidity does, until you stop noticing when it began and only feel its presence everywhere.</p>

  <p>At the front of the boat, the man stands without rowing.</p>

  <p>His hands rest loosely at his sides. He does not guide the boat because he does not need to. The boat knows where it is going. You sense this with a certainty that does not come from logic. The current does not push. It invites. The river narrows as you move forward, not sharply, not with resistance, but politely, like something guiding you closer with care and patience.</p>

  <p>Fireflies appear along the banks.</p>

  <p>At first they are few, scattered points of pale light blinking in and out of existence. Then they gather, clustering among roots and low branches, their glow uneven, pulsing in rhythms that do not match one another. They do not illuminate the path. They mark it. You have the unsettling feeling that if you were to stray even slightly from where the boat carries you, the lights would fade at once.</p>

  <p>Your chest tightens with a feeling that is not fear.</p>

  <p>It sits somewhere deeper, closer to recognition. Like hearing your name spoken softly by someone whose voice you cannot remember learning, yet have always known.</p>

  <p>Then the sound reaches you.</p>

  <p>A conch shell calls out across the water, long and low, its note stretching beyond where breath should allow. Another answers it, then another, the sounds overlapping and separating again, drifting through fog and trees. The calls do not come from a single place. They surround you gently, insistently, pressing in from all directions without ever growing loud.</p>

  <p>Beneath the shonkho, Mahalaya chants begin to rise.</p>

  <p>They are distant at first, layered and indistinct, voices folding into one another until individual throats disappear. The words carry more memory than breath, shaped by repetition rather than meaning. You do not understand every syllable, but your body does. Your skin prickles. Your spine straightens without effort. Your breathing slows, falling into time with the sound as if instructed.</p>

  <p>The boat begins to slow.</p>

  <p>Ahead, the bank widens, the mud firm and shaped by countless feet that know exactly where to step. The forest pulls back just enough to make space. Clay lamps flicker between exposed roots, their flames small but steady, protected from the damp air. Smoke curls upward in thin white threads, carrying the familiar smell of incense mixed with wet earth and river water.</p>

  <p>As the hull touches land, the chants grow clearer.</p>

  <p>You realize then that the calling was never meant to be heard with ears alone. It was meant to be answered. And it was that very call that led you here. There was no other reason for you to step into this boat, no other force that could have brought you so willingly into a place you did not know.</p>

  <p>Yet there is something else about this place that draws you. Something that should not be here.</p>

  <p>“Dāṛāiyā thākish nā. Mā jodi tore aikhāne āinche, tār māne tore aikhānei thākte hobe.”</p>

  <p>The voice is thin, but steady.</p>

  <p>An old woman stands at the edge of the bank, close enough that you can see the lines etched deep into her skin. Her sari is thin and faded, cotton worn almost translucent by years of sun, rain, and river water. It might once have been white or pale red. Now it sits somewhere in between, stained permanently by salt and mud that no amount of washing has ever fully removed.</p>

  <p>There is no shine left in the fabric. Only softness. The kind that comes from being used every day for decades.</p>

  <p>The border is narrow, barely decorated, its thread frayed where it has been tucked and retucked at the waist. The pallu is pulled over her head out of habit rather than care, shielding her hair from damp air and insects. It refuses to stay in place unless she holds it with one hand. The sari is worn higher than fashion would allow, knotted tight above the ankle so it does not drag through wet ground. The pleats are uneven, folded quickly, as if time has always mattered more than neatness.</p>

  <p>When she moves, the cloth clings briefly, then releases, carrying the smell of river water and smoke.</p>

  <p>It is not ceremonial. It is not new.</p>

  <p>It is a working sari, shaped by tides, weather, and years of standing at the edge of water, waiting for someone to return.</p>

  <p>You do not ask questions.</p>

  <p>You follow her as if this is the most natural thing in the world.</p>

  <p>The path reveals itself slowly. At first, there is no village at all. Only forest. Mangroves rise on either side, their roots twisting out of the mud like fingers that never learned to let go. Leaves brush against one another though there is no wind, and every sound you make seems to return to you slightly altered, softened, stretched.</p>

  <p>You become aware of your breathing. Your footsteps. The way your body occupies space.</p>

  <p>The forest seems aware of it too.</p>

  <p>The narrow path curves when you expect it to go straight, forcing you to turn your head, to adjust your pace, as if something wants to see your face from every angle. The old woman walks ahead, her faded sari moving like a pale marker through layers of dark green. She never looks back.</p>

  <p>When you hesitate, the forest tightens around the path.</p>

  <p>Branches lean in. Roots rise closer to the surface. The space narrows until stepping forward feels like the only reasonable option. It does not block you. It watches.</p>

  <p>Gradually, shapes separate themselves from the trees.</p>

  <p>A man stands beside a hut made of mud and bamboo, his posture stiff, his eyes fixed on you. Farther in, another figure emerges. Then a woman. Then two children. No one speaks. No one smiles. Their faces hold no curiosity, no fear. They watch you pass as if you are already known to them, already measured.</p>

  <p>Even the children do not move.</p>

  <p>Their eyes are too still. Their expressions too complete.</p>

  <p>The woman stops.</p>

  <p>Ahead of her stands a pandal, half-built. Bamboo poles rise unevenly, tied together with thick rope. Cloth hangs loose between them, unfinished, like skin waiting to be stretched. It should feel temporary. Fragile. Instead, it feels settled. Patient. As though it has always been here, waiting only to be completed.</p>

  <p>As soon as you see it, something shifts in the air.</p>

  <p>You cannot name it. You only feel it slide quietly into place, like a lock turning.</p>

  <p>Around you, faces change.</p>

  <p>One by one at first, then all at once, smiles spread across them. Not slowly. Not naturally. The same smile, mirrored perfectly, eyes brightening in unison. It is welcoming. It is wrong. And it is meant only for you.</p>

  <p>You finally speak.</p>

  <p>“Mā er dorshon korte eshechilum,” you say, your voice sounding smaller than you expect. “Amar ekhon kono thikana nei. Pujo jodi ekhane katate partum, apnader onumoti te.”</p>

  <p>Before the silence can settle, a man steps forward.</p>

  <p>He is younger than the old woman, his grip sudden and strong as his hands close around your shoulders. His face is close now, eyes sharp with something that looks like disbelief.</p>

  <p>“Tui āmāgore kemne pāili?” he asks.</p>

  <p>And the forest listens.</p>
