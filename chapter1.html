  <p>The clock on the dashboard shows 2:00 AM.</p>

  <p>The numbers glow dimly, as if unsure whether they should exist here. Incense smoke still floats inside the car, thin and stubborn. You lower the window and let the cold cut through the warmth. The smoke thins, loosens, slips out into the night. It takes its time, but it does leave.</p>

  <p>Something else stays.</p>

  <p>Her words return the way smells do, without permission, without warning.</p>

  <p>Jonmodin aar Mahalaya jedin tomar eksaathe porbe, shedin berobe na bari diye. Rahu royeche.</p>

  <p>You had laughed when she said it. Superstition spoken softly so it would not sound like fear. You had promised her you would be careful anyway, promised like people do when they do not intend to listen.</p>

  <p>The air outside is sharper than it should be. October air is supposed to carry dampness, not bite. This cold feels older, heavier, like it belongs to a different calendar. You look past the windshield. The road is barely visible. Fog presses against the headlights, swallowing light instead of reflecting it.</p>

  <p>An hour ago, you were still connected to the world. Signal bars. Music playing low. A road that made sense.</p>

  <p>Then the fuel needle fell. Not slowly. Not honestly. One moment it hovered, the next it collapsed. The engine coughed, resisted, surrendered. No warning light. No final mercy.</p>

  <p>Now there is no internet. No signal. No proof that anything exists beyond the fog.</p>

  <p>You reach under the seat and pull out the map.</p>

  <p>The paper is thick, yellowed, folded too many times along the same lines. You recognize the creases the way one recognizes scars. She had told you about it once, casually, as if it were a joke. You had found it days later on your doorstep, untouched by rain, untouched by dust. Only the map, and words written in a careful, deliberate hand.</p>

  <p>𑀫𑀸 𑀟𑀸𑀓𑀏</p>

  <p>You had stared at them for hours back then. They felt familiar without becoming clear, like a word on the tip of the tongue. That unease is what sent you back to your school.</p>

  <p>You remember every turn on the way to Sriram Vidyaniketan. The cracked wall near the banyan tree. The rusted gate that never quite closed. The building that had outlived the British and pretended it had outlived time itself.</p>

  <p>Mastarda had been there longer than anyone else. Doctor Sudhanshu Chatterjee. Senior most teacher. Permanent fixture. To see him seated as headmaster after nine years had felt unreal, like a dream continuing after you had woken up.</p>

  <p>“Areh, Akash Babu je. Eto din e nijer so called favorite teacher mone porlo bujhi?”</p>

  <p>You had smiled then. Flat. Embarrassed. You had said his name with respect because that was how you were taught to speak to him.</p>

  <p>“Sir, apnake ki bhabe bhulte pari bolun? Pratyashar toh kaan jhala fala kore ditum apnar karja karkhanar golpo korte korte.”</p>

  <p>The name changed the room.</p>

  <p>You had seen it immediately. The color leaving his face, draining like water from chalk. He tried to hide it, but you knew him too well for that.</p>

  <p>“Shunlum Pratyashar khobor,” he said after a pause that stretched too long. “I’m really sorry for what happened. But what can we do other than moving on with our lives, right?”</p>

  <p>That was when you stood up.</p>

  <p>You closed the curtains. You closed the door that connected the headmaster’s room to the administration office. You took the map from your duffel bag and placed it between you.</p>

  <p>His eyes widened. His skin went pale, then paler.</p>

  <p>“Sir, she’s still alive,” you said. “Ami jani or kichu hoini. I sent you texts regarding this map last week. You ignored them. You were hesitant to meet me today too. You know something. Please tell me what it is. And tell me what this writing means.”</p>

  <p>You waited.</p>

  <p>He did not answer. He looked at the clock instead. Not impatiently. Expectantly.</p>

  <p>The knock came then. Loud. Wrong. Someone shouting about a PTA meeting.</p>

  <p>You remembered the rules. Two knocks only. More only if there was a life threatening emergency.</p>

  <p>This was not that.</p>

  <p>“This is new, sir,” you said quietly. “Apnake amar khoon korar jonno sasta contract killer der dhore bedhe aante hobe, seta ami konodin expect korini. An honorable man of your status trying to kill an old student?”</p>

  <p>His face collapsed. What remained twisted into something unrecognizable.</p>

  <p>“Kī bolcho tumi, Akash?” he screamed. “Amar upor eto boro allegation lagachho? You have been behaving like this since last week. Ami tomake aagei janiye diyechi ei byapare ami kichu bolte parbo na.”</p>

  <p>The knocking turned violent. The door broke open.</p>

  <p>They came in with knives, with revolvers, with the confidence of men who believe the ending has already been decided. They stopped when the wall lit up.</p>

  <p>The video played without sound at first. Then the sound came. Her voice. Their laughter.</p>

  <p>You did not look away.</p>

  <p>Mastarda was there in the frame. Standing. Watching. Laughing.</p>

  <p>When they threw her into the pond, the water barely reacted.</p>

  <p>Silence followed. Then shouting. Then consequences.</p>

  <p>Everything after that pushed you here.</p>

  <p>The map ends an hour behind you. Beyond that, nothing.</p>

  <p>Google Maps never worked.</p>

  <p>The fog thickens before you realize the road has ended. Not broken. Not cracked. Simply gone.</p>

  <p>The car idles longer than it should. Headlights pour into white nothingness. When you step out, cold wraps around you immediately. The air smells wet, faintly rotten, with a trace of salt that does not belong inland.</p>

  <p>Water moves nearby. You hear it breathing against mud.</p>

  <p>The map told you to go straight.</p>

  <p>Now there is no straight.</p>

  <p>Only a narrow strip of earth sinking forward. Your shoes press into ground that yields slightly, as if it remembers being water. On one side, something tall and tangled blocks the light. On the other, emptiness.</p>

  <p>The fog eats distance. It eats direction.</p>

  <p>You turn. The car already feels far away, like a thought you abandoned.</p>

  <p>Wooden posts rise from the ground ahead. Old. Leaning. Their tops blackened by rain and time. No writing you can read. No lights from any village. Even sound feels careful here.</p>

  <p>You think of the words again.</p>

  <p>Maa. Dakai.</p>

  <p>They were never meant to explain. Only to summon.</p>

  <p>Movement stirs ahead. Not footsteps. Something sliding where land should resist it. The fog opens just enough for water to reveal itself, a narrow channel widening like a mouth.</p>

  <p>A boat waits at its edge. Low. Dark. Tied to nothing.</p>

  <p>On the boat stands a Durga pratima. Incomplete. Unpainted. Her eyes pale, unblessed, already watching.</p>

  <p>A man holds her steady with one hand.</p>

  <p>He looks ordinary. Almost familiar.</p>

  <p>When he sees you, he smiles gently, like someone relieved you finally understood where to come.</p>

  <p>“Mā ḍākāi,” he says.</p>

  <p>Mother calls.</p>
