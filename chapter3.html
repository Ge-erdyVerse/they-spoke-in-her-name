  <!-- THE FULL STORY (UNCHANGED) -->
  <p>The mantras begin again.</p>

  <p>They had stopped the moment you stepped forward, the moment your presence rippled through their rhythm like a stone dropped into still water. For a heartbeat they saw you as a disruptor, an intruder who should not have arrived early or at all. But that thought ended the instant they saw the map in your hands.</p>

  <p>“Mā ḍākāi,” they say together.</p>

  <p>Not loudly. Not softly. The sound falls out of their mouths like a single breath moving through many bodies. There is a faint tremble to the syllables, a kind of surrender, as if they are not speaking from faith but from recognition. Even the old man with the dead eyes goes still. His gaze had been sharp, hungry, too aware of you in a way that felt dangerous. Now it softens, melting into obedience.</p>

  <p>He is reacting to the words you used. The same words that came from the tape recorder. The tape that was sent to you without sender details, wrapped in plain paper, left at your door like a trapped heartbeat. The voice in it was hers. Fractured. Trembling. Still hers.</p>

  <p>You had kept that tape hidden. You had not let anyone see the way your hands shook the first time you heard her whisper:</p>

  <p>“Āmi Mahāṣṭomir prāsād bānāibo. Māyē nijer hāte khāoyāibo.”</p>

  <p>You had no idea what it meant. You still do not. But the way the villagers react tells you it means something they have been waiting to hear.</p>

  <p>They smile at your words. Not politely. Not with joy. With relief. Relief so deep it seems to loosen their bones, the kind that comes when a burden is lifted from their shoulders and placed onto yours.</p>

  <p>You understand suddenly that this is why they welcome you.</p>

  <p>Not because they love, not because they trust, not because they saw something worthy in you.</p>

  <p>They are relieved they will not have to do it themselves.</p>

  <p>A cold understanding presses into you, sharp despite the warmth of the pandal lights. And with it comes a memory. One you have avoided thinking about tonight.</p>

  <p>You remember who you used to be.</p>

  <p>You were never this perceptive. Never this calm. You were the one who spoke without thinking, who missed signs, who walked into rooms and knocked over the quiet. You were the one who always messed things up.</p>

  <p>And she was the one who caught you before you fell.</p>

  <p>You think of her now, not as a shadow or absence, but as she was. Light. Soft. Real. Her curly bangs brushing against your face when she leaned too close. Her hair always carried a hint of jasmine, mixed with the stronger smell of the shampoo she loved. When she laughed, the corners of her eyes folded in a way you could never describe correctly, but you always noticed.</p>

  <p>You had never needed to think around her. No carefulness. No decoding of unspoken words. You could sit with her watching silly rom coms, the ones she pretended she wanted to show you for your entertainment but really watched for her own comfort. She would fall asleep against your shoulder within minutes. You stayed awake longer than you needed to, staring at her hazel eyes half closed, fighting the urge to kiss her forehead.</p>

  <p>You loved her. Quietly. Fully. Helplessly.</p>

  <p>You prayed she felt something too.</p>

  <p>But then came the night you still cannot forgive yourself for.</p>

  <p>She came home late. Not once. Many nights in a row. You had told yourself it was her work, that her promotion demanded it, that she was finally becoming everything she wanted. But that thought twisted into something uglier the more you held it inside. Insecurity began to rot inside you. What were you doing with your life? Writing a novel you were not even sure would be published? What kind of partner did that make you?</p>

  <p>The night she came at three in the morning, drunk, laughing softly as her friend helped her to the door, you felt something inside you snap. Not because you distrusted her. You trusted her more than anyone. It was your own uselessness that scraped at your nerves.</p>

  <p>You shouted. You said things you never meant. She did not fight back. She did not accuse you. She simply cried. One small tear. Then she hugged you. Tight. Unbreakable. She apologized for upsetting you. She held you until your anger dissolved into shame. She let you sleep with your head against her chest, her hand smoothing your hair the way she always did when you were overwhelmed.</p>

  <p>The next morning she was gone.</p>

  <p>She left a sticky note on the fridge. Her handwriting neat, curved, warm.</p>

  <p>She wrote she was going to settle a small deal and come right home. She wrote that she knew you needed time. She wrote she would give you all of it. She wrote she loved you.</p>

  <p>She never returned.</p>

  <p>You told the police. They brushed it aside. A grown woman leaving home for a few days was not unusual. You kept insisting, but something felt wrong. There was a shadow in that silence. A wrongness beneath the normal explanations. And then the map came. The tape followed.</p>

  <p>You played the tape until you could not breathe. Until her voice scraped the inside of your skull. Until you wanted to tear your own eyes out rather than see what they did to her.</p>

  <p>Every step after that led you here.</p>

  <p>Now you stand at the edge of the pandal and let your eyes adjust.</p>

  <p>Bamboo poles rise unevenly from the ground, tied with rope that has turned dark and soft from years of moisture. The cloth overhead hangs low, sagging slightly, heavy with layers of incense smoke and countless breaths that have collected over decades. The structure feels old, not in the sense of time alone, but in purpose.</p>

  <p>At the center sits the Durga pratima.</p>

  <p>Not new. Not waiting.</p>

  <p>Already settled.</p>

  <p>The clay along her arms has cracked. Thin fissures trace the shape of her waist. Her face holds faint lines that resemble veins, as though she has dried and reformed many times. The once-bright paint has dulled into tired versions of itself. Reds fading toward brown. Gold flaking into dust. The eyes do not blaze like the idols you grew up seeing. They hold a quieter certainty, a steadiness born of long observation.</p>

  <p>She looks outward. Not fierce. Not merciful. Simply present.</p>

  <p>That is when you understand what feels wrong.</p>

  <p>She has not been taken away.</p>

  <p>No immersion. No farewell. No Bisharjan.</p>

  <p>She has remained here long after her season should have ended.</p>

  <p>Around you, villagers stand in silence. Some hold their palms together. Others simply watch. Their faces carry no grief, no urgency, no sense of an ending. A woman exhales softly, almost content. For a moment her mouth softens into something like gratitude. Relief. Then the expression vanishes. The identical smile returns, too uniform to belong to human muscles.</p>

  <p>You look at the old idol again.</p>

  <p>Her lion’s teeth are chipped. Mahishasur lies beneath her feet, his form worn down into gentleness instead of defeat. Nothing about the image suggests a victory. Nothing suggests a conclusion. The scene feels paused, stretched far beyond its natural state.</p>

  <p>Movement stirs behind you.</p>

  <p>The chanting grows louder, rolling forward like a tide carrying voices instead of water. You turn. Men emerge from the forest path, their feet moving in perfect rhythm despite the uneven mud. Their shoulders strain beneath a massive weight.</p>

  <p>The new pratima.</p>

  <p>Fresh clay. Wet paint. Fabrics that shimmer. The eyes glow with a clarity the old idol has long forgotten. But this clarity is not comforting. It is too sharp. Too aware. Unlike the old idol, this one does not look beyond you.</p>

  <p>Her gaze finds you instantly.</p>

  <p>Your body stiffens.</p>

  <p>As the men carry her closer, you notice something your mind refuses to accept. Something wrong in the arrangement of her limbs. The posture is familiar and unfamiliar at once.</p>

  <p>She is seated.</p>

  <p>Not poised to strike.</p>

  <p>Her hands do not hold weapons.</p>

  <p>They hold Mahishasur.</p>

  <p>She is pulling him apart. Clay muscles stretch between her fingers, shaped into the moment of tearing. His body is frozen mid-break. His mouth open in a scream that has no sound. Her lips touch the wound she creates. The paint around them is darker, as though the clay has remembered something it should not.</p>

  <p>The chanting rises until it trembles through your ribs. Drums answer with deep, slow pulses that merge with your heartbeat until you cannot tell whether the sound is coming from inside you or around you.</p>

  <p>The men do not slow.</p>

  <p>The villagers smile again. All at once. Perfectly timed.</p>

  <p>The old idol watches from the center of the pandal.</p>

  <p>The new idol is brought forward.</p>

  <p>Between them, the space closes. Air tightens. The world feels small. Crowded with breath and clay and devotion older than story.</p>

  <p>Something is about to happen.</p>

  <p>Something the village has been waiting decades to complete.</p>

  <p>And all of it moves toward you.</p>
