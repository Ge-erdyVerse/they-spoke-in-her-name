  <p>You take in the scene in fragments, your mind refusing to anchor itself to a single version of what is real. The light from the villa feels too clean, too deliberate, as if it has been arranged for your benefit. The darkness of the cave presses in behind you, damp and breathing, a presence you have begun to understand even if you do not trust it.</p>

  <p>You glance at the girl beside you.</p>

  <p>Earlier, she gave you a different name. A softer one. A lie meant to ease you forward. Shondhya or not, it no longer matters. Names feel thin here, easily discarded. They slide off the truth instead of holding it. What matters is the man standing in the open light and the boy smiling at his side.</p>

  <p>You watch Shondhya closely.</p>

  <p>She does not move toward them.</p>

  <p>There is no sudden cry of recognition, no relief breaking across her face. She does not call out to her brother. Her expression holds something hollowed out, stretched thin by repetition. A longing without urgency. You realize, slowly, that she has stood here before. Right at this boundary where darkness gives way to comfort. More than once. Many times. Each time stopping herself. Each time turning back.</p>

  <p>She takes a step away from the villa instead of toward it.</p>

  <p>The man calls her name again. His voice is warm and practiced, shaped by habit rather than concern. The boy breaks into a run, light on his feet, joy loose and uncontained. They reach the edge of the cave opening together and stop.</p>

  <p>Their bodies lean forward. Eager. Expectant.</p>

  <p>They do not cross into the darkness.</p>

  <p>It is not hesitation. It is restraint.</p>

  <p>Something unseen holds them in place. Not gently. Not cruelly. Absolutely.</p>

  <p>You feel it too.</p>

  <p>A subtle release in your chest, a quiet easing you had not realized you were holding back. Relief settles into you, unwanted but undeniable. Whatever keeps them there keeps you safe. For now. The boundary is real. It matters.</p>

  <p>Shondhya turns toward you.</p>

  <p>She steps close, close enough that you feel the warmth of her skin through the thin air. Her breathing is steady. Her face is calm, but her eyes are loud. They hold urgency. Warning. Something unfinished that refuses to be spoken.</p>

  <p>She does not say a word.</p>

  <p>She does not need to.</p>

  <p>Turn back.</p>

  <p>The meaning arrives slowly, like a truth you have been skirting for too long. She has come this far with you but no further. She never meant to cross. She needed someone else to see this place, to stand exactly where she always stops. Her hand lifts slightly, hovering in the space between you, careful not to touch, as if even contact might break a rule neither of you fully understands.</p>

  <p>Behind her, the man waits.</p>

  <p>His patience feels endless. Practiced over years. The boy tilts his head, still smiling, still watching. His eyes track every small movement you make. Bright. Curious. Like this is a game he has already won.</p>

  <p>You shift your weight.</p>

  <p>The cave exhales around you, cool and familiar now in a way the villa never will be. You realize that you belong more to this side of the threshold, at least in this moment. The thought chills you deeper than the damp air.</p>

  <p>Shondhya steps back again, deeper into the cave, making room for you to follow. Her gaze does not waver. She is not pleading. She is warning.</p>

  <p>The man calls her name once more, softer this time. The boy laughs. The sound is wrong here. Too light. Too easy. Neither of them move forward. Neither of them can.</p>

  <p>You stand between two worlds.</p>

  <p>The light from the villa feels distant now, almost artificial. The darkness at your back feels honest. Heavy. Earned.</p>

  <p>You take a breath.</p>

  <p>And you turn.</p>

  <p>“What was that?” you ask. “Why the fuck are we not going to them when your brother is right there?”</p>

  <p>Your voice echoes louder than you expect, scraping against the cave walls. You force it to sound careless. Confused. Like you still believe this is a misunderstanding that can be talked through. Like ignorance might protect you.</p>

  <p>She does not answer.</p>

  <p>Shondhya turns and walks deeper into the cave.</p>

  <p>You follow.</p>

  <p>Stopping now feels worse than whatever is waiting ahead. The cave no longer feels like a passage. It feels restless. Chaotic. As if the space itself is shifting when you are not looking directly at it. The walls press closer. Their surfaces glisten with moisture. Roots punch through stone like veins breaking skin.</p>

  <p>Water drips from above. Each drop lands at a different rhythm. Never forming a pattern. Never offering comfort.</p>

  <p>The bones appear again.</p>

  <p>More scattered now. Half crushed into the mud. Some embedded directly into the walls, as if the cave has been swallowing and remembering for a very long time. You feel like you are walking through layers of past movement. Footsteps laid over footsteps. Moments stacked without care.</p>

  <p>The air thickens. Breathing takes effort.</p>

  <p>She keeps walking.</p>

  <p>Then she stops.</p>

  <p>Nothing about this place looks different. Mud. Stone. Darkness. Yet her shoulders stiffen as if she has reached a mark only she can see.</p>

  <p>“Ekhane,” she says quietly. “It was right here he went missing.”</p>

  <p>Confusion flares hot in your chest. You step closer, sweeping your light across the ground, the walls, her face.</p>

  <p>“You already said that,” you say.</p>

  <p>The words barely leave your mouth before the cave changes.</p>

  <p>The air vibrates. Not with sound. With pressure. Your head swims, like standing too fast after sitting too long. The edges of your vision blur. For a brief, terrifying moment, the cave splits. Layers itself. Two versions occupying the same space.</p>

  <p>You see her standing in front of you.</p>

  <p>At the same time, you feel her far away.</p>

  <p>Then you hear her voice again.</p>

  <p>Not from her mouth.</p>

  <p>From somewhere distant. Hollow. Echoing through a space that does not belong to this moment.</p>

  <p>“Oke shara diyona,” the voice says. “She’s trying to take you away with her.”</p>

  <p>Your stomach drops.</p>

  <p>The ground shudders violently beneath your feet. Mud gives way without warning. You lose your balance and fall. The sensation is brief and endless at once. Weight disappears. Then returns all at once. Your body twists. Your light spins wildly before vanishing.</p>

  <p>Everything goes black.</p>

  <p>When your eyes open, the first thing you see is her face.</p>

  <p>Shondhya leans over you, close enough that you can count the strands of her hair, the faint lines of strain at the corners of her mouth. Her sunglasses are gone. Her eyes are sharp. Alert. Too awake.</p>

  <p>You blink.</p>

  <p>The cave is gone.</p>

  <p>You push yourself up and realize you are standing, not lying down. The cold dampness has lifted. The smell of rot and stone has been replaced by river air and wet leaves. Light filters through branches above, exactly as it should.</p>

  <p>You turn slowly.</p>

  <p>The mangrove tree stands before you, silent and unmoving. The crack in its trunk looks shallow now. Harmless. Like it could never swallow anyone whole.</p>

  <p>The forest feels normal.</p>

  <p>Shondhya watches you closely.</p>

  <p>“So you met them, didn’t you?” she asks.</p>

  <p>Her voice is steady.</p>

  <p>Nothing else is.</p>
