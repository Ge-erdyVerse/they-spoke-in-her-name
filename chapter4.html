  <!-- FULL STORY (NOT A SINGLE WORD REMOVED) -->
  <p>The old woman presses the prasad into your palms, her fingers dry and firm, her knuckles mapped with years that refuse to explain themselves. The sweetness clings faintly to your skin. You lower your head and speak the only phrase that feels safe, the greeting that threads through Bengal like muscle during these days.</p>

<p>Shubha Mahalaya.</p>

<p>She nods, satisfied that you know how to enter a blessed place. Or a condemned one. You raise the prasad to your lips, pretend to bite, let your jaw move in a gentle mimicry of devotion. The old woman watches with a quiet pride. When her gaze shifts toward a group of men arguing over bamboo poles, you loosen your fingers and drop the offering into the undergrowth beside the path.</p>

<p>You wait for the sound.</p>

<p>There should be a soft rustle. The faint complaint of leaves. A twig snapping under the weight of sweetness.</p>

<p>Instead, there is a dull thump. A sound too heavy for something so small. It hits the earth with intent, as if placed rather than dropped.</p>

<p>Your shoulders tense before your neck even turns.</p>

<p>You look back.</p>

<p>A girl stands at the edge of the clearing, resting one shoulder against a tree as if she has been watching you for longer than you realized. Light filters through gaps in the canopy, slicing across her face in narrow beams. Her hair falls around her cheeks in loose spirals, curls that look both wild and deliberate. They catch glimmers of sunlight and tighten slightly in the humidity.</p>

<p>Her skin is warm, touched with the soft sheen of someone who lives outdoors. Nothing fragile clings to her. She looks built for motion, her tank top faded by sun, her shorts worn at the hems. Her legs are strong, unshy, steadied by the kind of confidence you can only earn through long days and long distances.</p>

<p>Sunglasses hide her eyes, the dark lenses reflecting mangrove leaves and a thin slice of clouded sky. But the angle of her head, the stillness of her mouth, the shift in her shoulders, all say the same thing.</p>

<p>She is looking directly at you. Fully. Cleanly. Without hesitation.</p>

<p>She looks close to your age. Close enough to unsettle. Old enough to understand what you are. Young enough to leave without apology. Nothing about her fits the stillness of the village. She carries movement in every joint, every step, every breath.</p>

<p>Her voice arrives without warning.</p>

<p>It slices through the air casually, as though she is greeting a neighbor and not a stranger covered in sweat and dread. You flinch before you can stop yourself.</p>

<p>You have been wearing these jeans since before sunrise. More than eight hours in the same fabric, the same seams pressing into your thighs. The humidity has glued them to your skin. Sweat gathers beneath the waistband, prickling, then itching, then burning. Your breath has been shallow for hours. You have been holding yourself together, telling yourself you will find a room, peel them off, breathe again, exist in your boxers long enough to remember you are human.</p>

<p>The flinch breaks all of that.</p>

<p>Warmth spreads against the denim. You feel it instantly. Your chest locks. Your eyes widen. Your heart thunders in your throat. Shame sweeps up your spine in a hot, miserable wave.</p>

<p>You stare at her sunglasses, waiting for the reaction you fear. Waiting for disgust. Waiting for laughter. Waiting for someone nearby to shout.</p>

<p>Nothing comes.</p>

<p>She talks as if she has known you for years, as if this meeting is an interruption in her day, not your collapse.</p>

<p>“Tumi ekhan kar toh nou? Daddy ki tomakeo invite koreche ekhane?”</p>

<p>You cannot speak. Your tongue sticks to your teeth. You nod once, stiff and mechanical, eyes fixed not on her but somewhere past her shoulder, searching for an exit you cannot take.</p>

<p>Time stretches in slow, quiet pain.</p>

<p>Then she takes a step toward you.</p>

<p>Too close. Close enough for you to smell a mix of soap, river water, dust, and something sharp and clean beneath it. Her curls brush your cheek. She leans in, and her breath warms the thin shell of your ear.</p>

<p>Her voice drops. Softer. Too controlled.</p>

<p>“I know you pissed your pants,” she whispers. “And I saw you trying to throw away this prasad. If you do not want me to scream and tell the villagers everything, follow me.”</p>

<p>She pulls back. Her lips tilt slightly, not into a smile but into something like certainty. She turns and walks away without checking if you are behind her.</p>

<p>She knows you will be.</p>

<p>You follow her.</p>

<p>Not because of the threat. Not because she exposed you. Not because fear grips you like a fist. You follow because some part of you, the part that survived everything that brought you here, has already decided that turning back will hurt more than stepping forward.</p>

<p>Your feet move without your permission. The earth is soft. The mud gives slightly beneath your shoes. The smells shift from incense and smoke to salt and rot and wet bark.</p>

<p>The village grows smaller behind you. The forest rises.</p>

<p>The path is narrow. It curves before you think to adjust. Grass bends under her feet, then springs up again, erasing her steps. Leaves slap gently against your jeans, adding cold dampness to the humiliation already drying against your skin. Insects hum near your ears. Every sound feels close, personal, lowered into your bones.</p>

<p>She walks ahead at a pace that seems effortless. Her shoulders move gently with each step. Her arms swing in a loose rhythm that signals confidence, not carelessness. She moves like she belongs here, rooted not in stillness but in motion.</p>

<p>You try to match her stride and fail. Your legs drag. Sweat collects at the back of your neck. Breath grows tight. But you keep going. You do not want to lose sight of her. Not here. Not now.</p>

<p>Mangroves crowd closer. Their roots twist upward like exposed bones polishing under water. Thick knots of wood press into the earth, gripping mud as if the land itself might slip away. The air grows heavier, warmer near the ground, colder near the canopy. You breathe in the smell of rot softened by sweet forest sap.</p>

<p>Light becomes patchwork. It breaks across her back in strips, shimmering on her shoulders and dimming when branches weave tighter overhead. Your shoes make soft sounds as they press into wet leaves and shallow puddles, muted enough that it feels like the forest is listening to each step and choosing not to answer.</p>

<p>Then she stops.</p>

<p>You almost collide with her.</p>

<p>A single tree stands ahead. Larger than the others. Its trunk is broad and dark, smoothed in sections as though hands have touched it over many seasons. The bark dips in natural curves. Its roots do not stretch outward like claws but bend inward, folding themselves near the trunk, creating a shallow hollow at its base. It looks less like a tree and more like a figure leaning slightly forward, attending to something.</p>

<p>The air changes immediately.</p>

<p>Heavier. Still. As if everything in the forest has paused its breathing to watch.</p>

<p>Even the insects fall quiet.</p>

<p>You feel the shift crawl into your spine. You cannot name it. You only know you have stepped into a place that has been waiting for someone.</p>

<p>She does not look at you.</p>

<p>“Cholo aruktu kache gaacher,” she says. “I have something to show you.”</p>

<p>Your pulse thuds through the tight denim. You hesitate. You think again how extroverts are strange creatures, how they step into danger with ease, how they treat strangers like familiar shadows. You would never do this on your own. Never.</p>

<p>Yet you walk forward.</p>

<p>The trunk is enormous up close. A crack runs down its front, wide enough for an arm. Deep enough that light cannot touch the inside. The edges are smooth. Not broken. Worn. Polished by time or touch or something that returns again and again.</p>

<p>Air wafts from the opening. Cool. Damp. Carrying a smell that feels older than the forest itself.</p>

<p>She steps closer to the hollow.</p>

<p>Her fingers tremble at her sides. Her breath shifts. A faint break enters her voice, softening its earlier confidence.</p>

<p>“Amar choto bhai bhitore gechilo amar saathe,” she says. “We were not supposed to go this far. But he did. And I cannot find him. Can you help me?”</p>

<p>You look into the crack. Darkness stares back.</p>

<p>The forest exhales around you, slow and expectant.</p>

<p>Something waits behind that breath.</p>

<p>And you realize the girl has led you to a place where the forest listens not as witness, but as judge.</p>
