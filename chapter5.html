  <!-- FULL STORY (NOT A SINGLE WORD REMOVED) -->
  <p>You step inside and the world tightens around you before opening up again in a way that makes your breath stall. From the outside it looked like a crack, a violent wound in the tree. From the inside it reveals itself as something else entirely. A cavern, wide and deliberate, hollowed with intention rather than force. The walls curve inward smoothly, not splintered or raw. Their surface is dark, polished by age and touch. Your fingers brush the bark and it feels worn, almost softened in places, as if many hands have rested here and pushed forward.</p>

<p>There is a floor beneath your feet. Not roots. Not hard earth. Wood.</p>

<p>Planks stretch across the space, uneven and old, arranged with the care of someone who understood this hollow and returned often. Each step you take draws out a creak, low and subdued, the sound traveling deeper into the cavern before it fades. The wood smells damp and resinous, soaked in decades of monsoon air, but it holds firm. Someone built this. Someone wanted this place to endure.</p>

<p>Light filters dimly from the opening behind you. It is enough to reveal strange marks on the walls, patterns scratched repeatedly in a language that does not resemble words. A cluster of dried leaves rests in one corner, arranged so neatly that it refuses to be natural. The air is cooler inside, still and heavy, carrying the scent of mold and something faintly metallic.</p>

<p>Then your eyes settle on the floor.</p>

<p>A section dips lower than the rest, planks bowed inward as if something beneath them has been pressing upward. You crouch, press your hand against the center. It gives slightly under your palm. Your pulse quickens. You curl your hand into a fist and strike once. The wood groans. You strike again, harder.</p>

<p>The planks collapse inward, cracking at the edges and dropping into a square opening.</p>

<p>Darkness rises from below like breath.</p>

<p>You stare down into the black. Your mind races, but you refuse to voice a single question. Why build this in the heart of a forest. Why carve a hollow into a tree and hide a gate beneath it. Who comes here often enough to wear down walls and leave symbols behind. You swallow everything.</p>

<p>Behind you, she speaks.</p>

<p>Her voice trembles. Not with surprise. With recognition. Not fear of the cave. Fear of what she remembers.</p>

<p>“He went down there. I told him to stop and wait for me. He ran too fast. He was playing with his tennis ball and threw it far inside the cave. Then he vanished.”</p>

<p>She inhales sharply, fighting whatever tries to escape her throat.</p>

<p>“I am scared. I do not trust the villagers. I cannot tell Daddy or Maa or Dada or Didi. They will kill me if they hear I let Bhai go inside this place. Even after what happened last time.”</p>

<p>She stops. The silence thickens like tar. You feel the pressure of everything she refuses to say.</p>

<p>You do not ask. You know better than to help her shape her fear into words.</p>

<p>You lower yourself into the opening.</p>

<p>The drop is short but sharp. Your feet strike packed earth. Your knees bend on instinct, your hand finding the wall for balance. The air is colder here, heavier, wrapped in the smell of rot and water that has waited too long for movement. You lift your head.</p>

<p>She stands above you. A silhouette framed by faint light from the hollow. Her glasses hide her eyes. Her face is unreadable.</p>

<p>You steady your breath.</p>

<p>“Dekhao,” you say quietly. “Kothay gechilo.”</p>

<p>She climbs down after a pause, her shoes scraping the wall.</p>

<p>You begin walking.</p>

<p>The ground refuses to settle. Mud grips your shoes and releases them reluctantly, thick and layered, smelling of decay mixed with stale air. Your smartwatch becomes your only sun. Pale blue light flickers across walls that sweat silently. Every step reveals something new. Every shadow stretches too far.</p>

<p>Your phone remains dead in your pocket. A useless weight.</p>

<p>After what feels like hours, you check the watch. Forty three minutes. Only forty three. The number sits wrong in your mind, refusing to match the ache in your legs or the strained dryness of your throat.</p>

<p>You turn and look at her.</p>

<p>She is still behind you.</p>

<p>She should not be. She should be moving ahead with certainty, guiding you through this darkness as she did in the forest. Instead she walks slowly, shoulders curled inward. Her steps are cautious, almost timid. Her silence presses against you, growing heavier with each passing minute. You cannot tell if she is frightened or hiding something. You cannot tell which possibility unsettles you more.</p>

<p>You look again, expecting her to vanish. She remains. Smaller each time. Dimmer. As if something is swallowing the space between you faster than you can cross it.</p>

<p>Then she screams.</p>

<p>“Ekhane. It was right here he went missing.”</p>

<p>Her voice collides with the walls and fractures, returning to you warped and stretched. You stop at once. Your light jerks forward and lands on the ground.</p>

<p>Bones.</p>

<p>They litter the cave floor in uneven piles. Half buried in mud. Twisted together. Cracked. Hollow. Animal. Human. Child. Adult. All stripped of meaning, all abandoned here for reasons your mind refuses to process.</p>

<p>The mud around them is churned deeply, marked with impressions far larger than feet, as if something heavy dragged or moved through this place again and again.</p>

<p>Your throat tightens.</p>

<p>You do not ask how she knows the spot. You do not ask how many times she has stood here.</p>

<p>Instead, you lift your wrist and point upward.</p>

<p>“Does your brother climb roofs and everything.”</p>

<p>Your light follows the angle of your hand. The ceiling rises higher here, ridged and wet. Along its surface are handprints and footprints. Small. Bare. Leading upward. Leading forward. Leading deeper into the cave.</p>

<p>She nods. A small, violent motion.</p>

<p>You move again.</p>

<p>Then something changes.</p>

<p>It does not happen all at once. It happens the way sleep collapses into dreaming. A blink. A step. A breath.</p>

<p>And the world begins to lose its shape.</p>

<p>Sounds shift first. They come from everywhere but also nowhere, turning soft things into hard ones, hard things into soft ones. A drop of water against stone echoes like a voice. A breath behind you fades before it forms. The cave seems to speak without language.</p>

<p>Shapes begin to pulse at the edges of your light. Some expand when you are not watching them. Some shrink. Some wait for your eyes to pass over them before moving again. You do not name any of them. Naming would make them real.</p>

<p>The walls breathe with you.</p>

<p>The ceiling rises and falls, narrowing and stretching like a living cage. Your steps grow both slower and faster. You lose count of how many times you blink. You lose count of your breaths. You lose count of the number of times you almost trip over something that is no longer there when you look down.</p>

<p>Your sense of size falters. You feel small, then large, then lost.</p>

<p>Your sense of age falters too. You feel younger for moments, then older than you should be, as if the cave is folding time around your body. Minutes loosen. Seconds melt. The air thickens and then thins again.</p>

<p>You move through a stretch of darkness that refuses to remember itself. A place that feels like a tunnel and a room and a throat all at once. A place that stretches time until it breaks. Something touches your shoulder once. Or maybe twice. Or maybe not at all.</p>

<p>You refuse to look back.</p>

<p>You refuse to ask how long you have been inside.</p>

<p>You refuse to acknowledge the thought forming at the edges of your mind: that you might have stepped out of time entirely and into something else.</p>

<p>You keep walking because stopping feels more dangerous.</p>

<p>Then the ground changes.</p>

<p>Mud becomes stone. Heavy. Cold. Solid in a way the rest of the cave never was. Air moves freely again, brushing against your skin like a long sigh. Light appears ahead, faint at first, then stronger, steady and warm like a lamp left burning for someone’s return.</p>

<p>You step forward and the cave ends.</p>

<p>A villa stands in front of you.</p>

<p>White walls. Wide windows. A veranda washed in evening light. Clean tiles. Iron grills. Curtains that move gently from the breeze of a room you cannot see.</p>

<p>There are no trees here. No roots. No mangroves. No forest. It feels like stepping into a memory you did not live.</p>

<p>It feels like time jumped.</p>

<p>A man steps out.</p>

<p>You recognize him at once. The man from the pandal. The man whose face did not change when he saw you arrive. He looks at the girl now. His expression softens as if she is the only thing in the world he has worried about.</p>

<p>“Maa Shondhya, eto khon kothay chhili re. Ar tui Babu, tor kotha-i ba ki.”</p>

<p>Your breath catches.</p>

<p>A child runs out from behind him.</p>

<p>Her brother.</p>

<p>He looks at you strangely, too still, too calm, too ready. His smile is wide and easy, the smile of someone who has found exactly what he wanted inside the cave.</p>

<p>The man’s eyes turn to you slowly.</p>

<p>They linger.</p>
